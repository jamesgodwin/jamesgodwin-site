<p>AI has been very helpful for me. Can't resist secondhand book stores and finding new interpretations of the I Ching. Have collected many over the years. Feed all of my books into an LLM and it has compiled a new set of interpretation of the 64 hexagrams which now travels around with me as an app on my phone. - <a href="https://aiching.app" target="_black">aiching.app</a></p>

<p>I think the gratitude practice is under utilised. But also the world needs to witness gratitude. I have created a map of the world and you can begin watching it now and witness expressions of gratitude happening in real-time all around the world. Hopefully this grows and one day when I visit my site it is just a glow of activity as every corner of the world lights up with thanks. - <a href="https://gratefulfor.com" target="_black">gratefulfor.com</a></p>
