      My journey began with a foundation in both <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> and <strong>Graphic Design</strong> â€” two seemingly distinct disciplines that have shaped my unique approach to design and innovation. Engineering has provided me with a robust technical framework to navigate the complexities of technology, while my passion for art and design has deepened my empathy for users, enabling me to create intuitive, human-centered experiences. By merging these two worlds, I've developed a unique perspective that drives the businesses and products I build, ensuring they are both technically sound and deeply connected to the needs and desires of their users.
