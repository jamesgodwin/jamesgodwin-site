<p>While travelling abroad, I became fascinated with <a href="https://dantian.co.za/taoism-and-tai-chi/"  target="_blank">Taoist philosophy</a>. There exists a long history of movement and exercise systems associated with Taoism. Tai Chi is deeply connected with Taoist philosophy and notions. This is illustrated in the Chinese works <a href="https://aiching.app/i-ching/2024/03/15/exploring-the-essence-of-lao-tzus-tao-te-ching/" target="_blank">Tao Te Ching</a> and <a href="https://aiching.app/what-is-the-i-ching/" target="_blank">I Ching</a>.</p>

<p>After returning home, I was fortunate to find a teacher, <a href="https://dantian.co.za/dr-lin-feng-chao/"  target="_blank">Grandmaster Dr Lin Feng-Chao</a>. His teacher was <a href="https://dantian.co.za/cheng-man-ching/"  target="_blank">Cheng Man-Ching</a>. I began practising in my early 20s, and now 30 years later, I realise the amazing benefits I have gained from the daily practice of Tai Chi.</p>

<p><p>At work, if stressed, I often head outside and practice some Tai Chi. Work colleagues would notice me practising and ask if they could join in. They were soon asking me during office hours if I could run another class at lunch because they were feeling stressed. This lead me to dive deeper into the <a href="https://dantian.co.za/health-benefits-of-tai-chi/" target="_blank">health</a> and <a href="https://dantian.co.za/tai-chi-is-meditation-in-motion/"  target="_blank">meditation</a> benefits of Tai Chi. In my journey, I came across the work done by Google on their 'Search Inside Yourself' course. I found their research fascinating, especially with regard to the 6 key traits of a good software engineer. It turned out that two were IQ and the remaining 4 were emotional intelligence. What is mind-blowing is that emotional intelligence is trainable through the practice of meditation. This lead me to explore the value of Tai Chi more and build a mindfulness program at <a href="https://jumo.world/"  target="_blank">Jumo</a> for not only the engineers.</p>

Tai Chi trains one to calm the mind on demand and return it to a natural state of happiness. Deepen self-awareness in a way that fosters self-conﬁdence, which harnesses empathy and compassion. These are valuable traits for outstanding leadership. Builds highly productive collaborations based on trust and transparent communication in the workplace.</p>
