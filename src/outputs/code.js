<p>While design is my first love, I've found coding to be an unexpectedly creative pursuit. As a self-taught programmer with over two decades of experience, I've built a strong foundation in multiple coding languages and frameworks. This expertise has allowed me to create scalable, secure, and user-friendly applications, from developing mobile wallets and financial systems to building real-time online platforms. My coding skills are diverse and adaptive, always driven by the desire to craft meaningful digital experiences. Thanks to AI, I now code better and faster, with less struggle and more creativity.</p>

<p>This websites <a href="https://github.com/jamesgodwin/jamesgodwin-site" target="_blank">code is available on GitHub</a>. Feel free to share and help me improve as this was my first React project.</p>
